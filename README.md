# Me VS Depression

A repository for me to write about my thoughts/feelings, try to understand them and possibly help someone in the meantime. In case you feel similar to me, feel free to reach out any time! I have another repo called "socials" where you can probably find a communication-channel that works for both of us.

Once upon a time, there was a person who carried a heavy burden deep within themselves. It was a burden called depression. At first, it was just a whisper, a subtle feeling of sadness that lingered in their heart. But as time went on, it grew louder, gradually permeating every corner of their existence.

Depression became more than just an emotion; it was a constant companion that shadowed their every step. It cast a heavy weight upon their shoulders, making even the simplest tasks feel like monumental challenges. The person's once vibrant thoughts and joyful moments began to fade, replaced by a persistent emptiness that seemed impossible to fill.

As days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, depression dug its claws deeper into their psyche. It distorted their thinking, convincing them that happiness was an illusion and that they were destined to remain trapped in this dark, endless tunnel. The person's energy waned, leaving them weary and drained, as if their very essence was being consumed by the relentless grip of depression.

At times, they tried to push it away, fighting against the suffocating presence that had become so ingrained within them. But no matter how hard they fought, depression remained steadfast, clinging to their identity like an uninvited guest who refused to leave.

With each passing day, depression whispered insidious lies, chipping away at their self-esteem and hope. It created a distorted mirror through which they saw themselves, distorting their perception until they questioned their worth and doubted their ability to ever escape its grasp.

Yet, deep within their core, a flicker of resilience remained. A constant thought: "Is this what defines me"? Or will I reign victorious?

## 07/06/23 Understanding

Since I was 12-13 years old, I have thought at least once about suicide every day. Which is probably the most constant thing that I've actively/passively been doing. Nothing in my life has been as constant as this weird abstract feeling of not wanting to be alive. Why is it so prevalent?

I have always felt as if I had to supress my feelings, part of it was probably to avoid getting bullied and/or taken advantage of. Maybe I should get more in touch with my emotions again, but how?

A note for **if you don't understand depression**:

1. no one wants to be depressed, its not a choice
2. there is most likely a cause(-s) for depression, events that ...
3. either you can get out of it, or eventually you get out of it -> only 2 end stages
4. its not easy to get rid of it, you can't just "snap out of it"
5. its not just feeling sad and low, but rather a persistent and very invasive emotion/mood that stays with you, often for months or even years
6. it is often hidden in plain sight, the person that you like to talk to, might very well be depressed, you can't see it on someone's faÃ§ade
7. its very often misunderstood by everyone that doesn't have it or haven't directly come in contact with it
8. not everyone with depression wants to die

Not to say, I'd rather be anything but depressed.

## 05/06/23 - You're not alone

All I want to do, is to be of service to others, even when that means my downfall. Why do I want to help others?
Why did I create this repository?
Maybe because I have empathy?
Because I know how it feels like to think you're alone in this? I feel it daily.
Maybe because I wish, that someone one day will be there for me? I try to be that someone for someone else.

You're not alone, I am out here! But am I ...?

## 04/06/23 - No end in sight

I don't see how I could get rid of this. When it will go away. How it can go away.

How I can make it go away.

A permanent feeling, something or someone that's haunting you.

It stalks you everywhere you go. There is no hiding. No moment of rest.

Maybe, I'm too demanding, and just have to let it go. Not be busy with it every so often. In order for it to leave my mind, me... .

Maybe I shouldn't let it rest. Or maybe I really should let it rest. Otherwise it might be me that rests.

## 01/06/23 - Everlasting sadness

Often I get told that I have no right to be depressed, because I have a fairly decently paying job, a wife, a family that loves/supports me, ... . The life some people wished they had, I guess. That however doesn't help to get rid of this everlasting/omnipresent feeling. Whatever I do, this weird feeling follows me, eats away any other feeling. Its like falling into a pit, deeper and deeper -> day by day, with no end in sight. Like one of the nightmares I had when I was younger: I'd wake up, be in my bed, but my bedroom had no walls, it was a freestanding platform with a bed in the corner, surrounded by void on all sides, the only way to escape the platform was by jumping of it, falling into the endless void, till I got looped back to the bed and woke up again, and again, always on repeat, for night on end.

In my experience this feeling, of not being able to escape this room, is what depression feels like. Wherever I go, wherever I am, whatever I do, this nightmare follows me and nibbles pieces of me.

I've gone to therapists in the past, with no real effect.

The weird things is, I don't want my life to be all that much different. Just in a few specific areas, like the location/country I live in, get rid of depression, ... . Very non vital desires, that wouldn't impact my life in a huge way, compared to someone not earning a decent wage or something and hitting the "jackpot".

Life is weird. People are weird. Computers are weird. Everything is weird.

## 30/05/23 - Why do I even bother?

What is there to live for? Everyone is screwed from the start. The politicians are against the people, the people are against their peers.

Even in daily life, everyone is so cold. Like no one cares about what'd happen. If I'd jump off a building or in front of a train, people would stare and go back to work. We are all a bunch of pussies, sheep, emotionless beings. There is nothing of beauty to find in most humans, just cold stares as soon as you get near to them.

For as long as I can remember I've been feeling empty. Like my emotions come and go, but there is only 1 that truly sticks. A permanent feeling of sadness, for whatever reason, and something that's unexplicable. How can I get rid of this?

I feel as I'm in service of others, instead of myself. How can I help others, if I can't help myself with this "demon".

This feeling of emptiness makes me hate myself. I can't do anything good.

Recently I listened to [this song of XXXTENTACTION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3U1TKgwoxE) for the first time in a while, I feel somewhat understood, not by the music, but the cover art stating: "I do the same fucking shit everyday. Everyday feels like Sunday I cannot escape. My mind is sick, my mind is fucking sick. I am not satisfied with anything. I do not care about progressing in life. Throughout my life I cared about other people who did not care about me. No one truly cares anyway. Life is just a waste of time. Even though my family says they care. Deep down, they do not. Friends will come and go. You know my fucking life is a joke and I'm truly lost in life. My friend saved my life. My friend saved my fucking life. Its getting less stressful and crazy now but still I'm lost. I see the fake humans and their fake smiles with their fake love. I'll fucking kill all of them. I am not crazy. I truly am not. The only reason I am alive is because of the people who were there for me when I was crying desprerately for help. Help. Help. My real family is dead to me. But I will always love them. They didn't want to accept the fact that I was fucked up. You're not depressed you're not sad you're wasting your time, they didn't get it until it was over. I saw everything before it happened.
No one cared until they saw me progressing . Losing friends was the best thing that has ever happened to me. Now people come in my life, I am very grateful for them and everyone around me. I constantly get let down . I always get let down. Maybe because I expect so much from people who truly don't give a fuck about me. I get attached to people I shouldn't have. I expect too much. Might as well say fuck 'em. And fuck it. I'll die alone. HAHAHA. I'm such a fucking pussy. Depressed hopeless. Well at least I know who I am.".

How is it possible that I have more in common with a dead man, that lived on the other side of the planet, than most of those I am surrounded by? Why do his words touch my heart, make me tear up? He and his words, were also the inspiration for this repo?!.

Even though, I have no idea what this man has gone through. I respect him a ton. I wish this feeling of complete and utter uselessness on no one, not even my worst enemy. Yet it is something I have to bear everyday. Sometimes, if people only felt a sliver of how bad I constantly feel, maybe then they'd understand, maybe then we could have a real conversation, not hiding behind facades.

Socail-media and everything surrounding it is a disease to society. The only somewhat true social media is livestreaming, people can't hide who they really are there, or at least less, people are more pure, the way everyone should be.

Pure people are hard to come by, and those that I treasure the most, respect without knowing them. Often you can just feel when someone is pure and see easily those who hide behind facades, trying to fit in, trying to be accepted, instead of just being themselves.
