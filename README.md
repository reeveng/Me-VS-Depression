# Me VS Depression

A repository for me to write about my thoughts/feelings, try to understand them and possibly help someone in the meantime. In case you feel similar to me, feel free to reach out any time! There is another repo socials where you can probably find a communication-channel that works for both of us.


## 30/05/23 - Why do I even bother?

What is there to live for? Everyone is screwed from the start. The politicians are against the people, the people are against their peers.

Even in daily life, everyone is so cold. Like no one cares about what'd happen. If I'd jump off a building or in front of a train, people would stare and go back to work. We are all a bunch of pussies, sheep, emotionless beings. There is nothing of beauty to find in most humans, just cold stares as soon as you get near to them.

For as long as I can remember I've been feeling empty. Like my emotions come and go, but there is only 1 that truely sticks. A permanent feeling of sadness, for whatever reason, and something that's unexplicable. How can I get rid of this?

I feel as I'm in service of others, instead of myself. How can I help others, if I can't help myself with this "demon".

This feeling of emptiness makes me hate myself. I can't do anything good.

Recently I listened to [this song of XXXTENTACTION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3U1TKgwoxE) for the first time in a while, I feel somewhat understood, not by the music, but the cover art stating: "I do the same fucking shit everyday. Everyday feels like Sunday I cannot escape. My mind is sick, my mind is fucking sick. I am not satisfied with anything. I do not care about progressing in life. Throughout my life I cared about other people who did not care about me. No one truly cares anyway. Life is just a waste of time. Even though my family says they care. Deep down, they do not. Friends will come and go. You know my fucking life is a joke and I'm truly lost in life. My friend saved my life. My friend saved my fucking life. Its getting less stressful and crazy now but still I'm lost. I see the fake humans and their fake smiles with their fake love. I'll fucking kill all of them. I am not crazy. I truly am not. The only reason I am alive is because of the people who were there for me when I was crying desprerately for help. Help. Help. My real family is dead to me. But I will always love them. They didn't want to accept the fact that I was fucked up.".
